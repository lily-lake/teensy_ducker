 *
 * This is a general purpose audio compressor block (C++ class). It works by determining
 * the average input of the input signal, and based on a pre-determined curve,
 * changes the gain going through the block.
 * A good discussion is the Wikipedia page:
 *     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression
 * This compressor includes up to 5 dB/dB line segments allowing for most of the
 * features listed.  These include
 *   Multi segment compression curves, up to 5
 *   Limiting
 *   Approximation to "soft knees"
 *   Expansion for suppressing low-level artifacts
 *   Anticipation
 *   Scale offset for use such as hearing-aid audiology
 * This is derived from the WDRC compressor. Chip Audette (OpenAudio) Feb 2017
 * Which was derived From: WDRC_circuit from CHAPRO from BTNRC: https://github.com/BTNRH/chapro

/* Compressor #2.  Amplifies input signals by varying amoounts depending
 * on the signal level.  This is controlled by up to 5 line segments specified
 * by a point at the highest input level for the line along with a compression ratio
 * (1/slope) for the line segment. This can provide limiting at the highest inputs
 * by setting compressionRatio[0]=1000.0 (i.e., some big value).  Expansion at the
 * lw levels provides a squelch action, using a very small compression
 * ratio like 0.01.
 *
 * A special case is the [0] segment, that continues at the same slope for inputs up
 * to any level.  For this the kneeDB[0] can be the expected 0.0  or other values
 * on that line.  The output level for kneeDB[0] is the input variable, marginDB.
 * This allows gain control near clipping but below.  marginDB is typically 1 or 2 dB.

 * The graph shows the changes in gain on a log or dB scale.  A compressionRatio
 * of 1 represents a constant gain with level.  When the compressionRatio is greater
 * than 1, say 2.0, the voltage gain is decreasing as the input level increases.
 *
 * vInDB refers to the time averaged envelope voltage.
 * The zero reference is the full ADC range output. This is Â±1.0
 * peak or 0.707 RMS in F32 terminology.
 *
 * The curve is for gainOffsetDB = 0.0. This parameter raises and lowers the
 * input scale for the kneeDB[] parameter.
 *
 * Timing: For 44.1 kHz sample rate and 256 samples per update, the update( ) time
 * runs 240 to 270 icroseconds using Teensy 3.6.

    /*          Definition of the compression curve.
     * Input and output are normally referenced to the full scale range (-1.0 to 1.0 in float).
     * The full scale point is called 0 dB.
     * There are 5 slopes, specified by the top input level for each line segment (kneeDB[])
     * and the Compression Ratio (1/slope) of the segment (compressionRatio[]).
     * These are numbered from the highest to the lowest allowing
     * the number of segments to be adjusted, i.e., there is always a segment 0
     * but there may not be a segment 3 and 4, for instance. This becomes very flexible,
     * as there can be, say, compression for top levels and expansion for very low levels.
     *
     * A special case is segment 0.  On a plot of output dB vs input db, an input
     * level of kneeDB[0] produces an output of marginDB. A typical marginDB might
     * be -1.0 or -2.0.  This margin allows controlling the gain without clipping in the DAC.
     *
     * This structure can have multiple curve structures like cCurve that can be used by
     *     cmpr1.setCompressionCurve(&cCurve);
     *     cmpr1.begin();
     *
     * Unused segments can have knees like kneeDB[4] at, say -1000.0f.
     * Values below -500 will slightly speed up the update() function.  if the bottom
     * two segments are not used, kneeDB[3] would also be set to -1000.0f amd so forth.
     *
     * Finally, there is a variable offsetDB that allows for a shift in the input scale.
     * It simply shifts the definition input levels, in dB.
     * This allows converting from DSP scales that have 0dB at full DSP scale
     * to auditory scales such as are used in the Tympan library. An offsetDB=119.0
     * would allow all inputs to be in "SPL" units with a maximum input value of 119.
